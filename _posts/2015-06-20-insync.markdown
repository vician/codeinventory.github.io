# Insync 1.2.11

I updated Fedora to 22 (via FedUp) a few weeks ago. Almost everything works good but I found a problem with [Insync](https://www.insynchq.com/). It stopped automatic starting after boot and it wasn't possible to run it manually.

I discovered an error mesage:

{% highlight bash %}
$ insync start --no-daemon
./insync: symbol lookup error: /lib64/libpangoft2-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: FcWeightFromOpenType
{% endhighlight %}

Official support forum has two threads for it:

* <https://support.insynchq.com/t/new-insync-version-1-2-11/1367/11>
* <https://support.insynchq.com/t/new-insync-version-1-2-10/1168/18>

The first suggests installing `pango-1.36.8-5.fc21.x86_64.rpm` which I don't want to right now.

The suggestion from second thread is better. At first you can try if it works by this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ insync start --headless --no-daemon
{% endhighlight %}

You should see some messages with a list of directories which are watched.
And you can run it as a daemon by this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ insync start --headless
{% endhighlight %}

You can of course create an automatic starting of this command after boot.
The bad thing is that I still don't know how to reconfigure Insync for changing directory or google account etc.

I hope Insync will fix this issue as soon as possible. But the synchronization works for me right now, which is good.

# Insync 1.2.14

[Insync](https://www.insynchq.com/) (finally) fixed a problem below (with Insync 1.2.11) but [installation of new version isn't pure automatic](https://support.insynchq.com/t/new-insync-version-1-2-13-1-2-14/1814/5). The fixed version of Insync is 1.2.14 but automatic upgrade will fail like this:

{% highlight bash %}
Installing  : insync-1.2.14.35168-fc21.x86_64                                                                                                                     1/1 
Error unpacking rpm package insync-1.2.14.35168-fc21.x86_64
error: unpacking of archive failed on file /usr/lib/insync/faulthandler-2.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg: cpio: rename
insync-1.2.14.35168-fc21.x86_64 was supposed to be installed but is not!
{% endhighlight %}

You have to remove Insync and install it again by this:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo dnf -y remove insync
sudo rm -r /usr/lib/insync
sudo dnf install insync
{% endhighlight %}

Now your Insync should works again (also with GUI).
